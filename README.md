Bash scripts to run experiments for the Fixed-Point-Controller, https://github.com/robomorphic/Fixed-Point-Controller
This code assumes that the Fixed-Point-Controller is a sif file that is running on a high-performance computer. To run this code, Fixed-Point-Controller must be configured and made, and then saved as a tar file. If you can run the Fixed Point Controller without accessing an external computer or by sending jobs, ignore fb.sb
